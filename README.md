Fall 2024 
Course   Information
Object-Oriented Programming II is a 4 credit   introductory course   in fundamental data   structures (lists, trees,   hashing,   heaps, graphs, etc.) and their efficiency.   Programming      is done   in Java.   It   is the second   part of a two-semester course sequence   required   for computer science and computer engineering majors.
In addition to the   policies   in this syllabus,   many   important   University   policies apply to   students.Review this page for a summary of these policies.
Prerequisites: Minimum grade of C-   in CMSC131; or must   have   earned   a   score   of 5   on   the A Java AP exam; or must have   earned   a   satisfactory   score   on the   departmental placement exam; and   minimum grade of C-   in   MATH140.
Course   Materials and Textbook 
Course   materials will   be   provided via   ELMS, the   University's   learning   management system.   Essential announcements for the course will   be   made   in the class   Piazza.   Be   sure to check   Piazza and   ELMS on a   regular   basis for   updates.
There is no required textbook. A recommended textbook   is:

Office   Hours and Class Communication

Office   hours get extremely   busy the day   before an assignment deadline   and   getting   help   is not guaranteed. Please start your assignments early so you can address any 
problems during office hours.
Email should be used only for urgent matters and   not to address   project   questions,   lecture   material questions, etc.
Piazza will   be used for questions and discussions about   classwork   and   projects. You
are   responsible for reading current   posts to see   if your question   has already   been asked   and answered. You are   NOT   permitted to   post   program code   in   Piazza,   ELMS or any
other app or website.   For questions about your program,   plan to attend   office   hours   to   discuss with a   TA.
Coursework Grading and   Exam   Dates 
Coursework and assessments will count toward the final grade according   to   the   following percentages:

Midterms will be given in person during lecture on the dates shown. If you   have   a   conflict with an exam date due to a   reason   covered   by the   University   policy,   report   this      to the   instructor as early as   possible. You will   potentially   be asked to stay   in   the classroom   for   each   exam   until   the   class   period   ends.   (See the absences section below for additional important information.) 
All grades will   be   recorded   in   ELMS.   Percentages will   be applied to determine the final   grade. Some quizzes   may not count   towards   the final   grade.
Final course grades will   be curved as   needed,   based on   each student’s   total   numeric   score for all coursework at the end of the semester.   (In   other words,   individual assignments are   not curved; just the final course grade.)   It   is expected that   plus/minus   grades will be given, although the distribution of grades   and   performance   of students will dictate the   curve.
